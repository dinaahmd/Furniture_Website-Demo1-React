            <p className='fs-5'><a href="/home">Furnitchy</a> sells furniture, appliances, and home accessories, but this does not lead to complicated navigation. The navigation menu on the website allows a customer to browse furniture by categories or rooms and to see current special deals. The way to organize product information on product pages is excellent. All product details are arranged into several buttons that open into a corresponding sidebar. This does not intimidate customers with an avalanche of information, yet gives as many details as they need on demand.</p>
